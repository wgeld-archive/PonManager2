## Introduction
The PON Manager application is a tool designed to facilitate the management and operation of PONs. This repository will house the codebase for the application, and new features will be developed and tracked in separate branches. Currently, the application supports two primary functions:

- **PON Search**: Search and retrieve details about specific PONs.

We anticipate expanding the feature set of the PON Manager in the future to better serve the needs of its users.
